# ðŸš¬ Data-Driven Analysis of Smoking Habits among University Students using Machine Learning

This project explores the smoking habits of university students through real-time data collection and machine learning techniques. Our goal is to identify patterns and potential predictors of smoking behavior, enabling better awareness and informed interventions.

---

## ðŸ“Š Overview

- **Dataset**: Collected real-time data through surveys and forms from university students.
- **Techniques**: Applied various machine learning models to analyze the smoking behavior and identify significant influencing factors.
- **Visualization**: Used Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas for clear and insightful data visualization.
- **Outcome**: Data-driven insights that can support awareness campaigns and student wellness initiatives.

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

We evaluated each model using standard classification metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
